# Bootstrap

OLC CODEJAM 2020 entry

Hello 0xA5A5A5A5, we have a very important job to you.

As you know, The Great Machine is the computer which runs the simulation which we call "the universe". While preparing his next YouTube video, "Code-It-Yourself: Unvierse Simulator", Javidx9 has overloaded The Great Machine's power circuits and the inception protection mechanism has been triggered to shutdown The Great Machine, but not before significant damage was done to several critical circuits. The system watchdog, an opto-mechanical Turing machine, has taken control and will direct you in your quest to bootstrap The Great Machine, and bring the universe back online.

Should you fail in your task then your entire department's funding will be pulled and given to that obnoxious moron Jenkins on the second floor, and you and your colleagues will be assigned to other duties. So the stakes aren't really that high. You might as well give it a shot though. You've got until next Tuesday.
