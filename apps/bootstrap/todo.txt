(+) 1. implement an emulator for the CPU(!!) because I can't think of a better way to validate puzzle solutions
(+) 2. link the puzzle mini-game with the map exploring / shmup game (you start the mini-game by raising an NMI with a nearby illegal opcode
(+) 3. make the illegal opcode's bullets damage the player (yes, illegal opcodes fire bullets, get used to it)
(+) 4. add some puzzles (i.e. opcodes for to implement in the puzzle game)
--- 5. add map based quests / progression
6. add victory condition / state
(+) 7. add defeat condition / state
--- 8. add sfx
--- 9. add background music
--- 10. add controller support
(+) 11. link up the front-end
(+) 12. User manual 
13. CPU reference
--- 14. inter-entity collisions
15. Cheat / hint - encode a solution in the puzzles, allow the user to study the solution and then clear the grid
--- 16. Win32 build
--- 17. Windows 7 compatibility (exclude xinput?)
16. Rev-C CPU: Indexed instructions
17. Death / destruction animations
18. color blind -- use shapes as well as colors to distinguish wires
(+) 19. Sort wires in lines in order that they are signalled within a cycle
(+) 20. Hints for documentation.
