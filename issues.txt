* Having all apps build under the inept solution is not great - create solutions for each apps
* File system isn't working for me - the //<container/... path idea is fine but I'd also like to be able to mount a container or directory and then open files with //<mountpoint>/... paths
* File loads are synchronous
* draw functions are a bit of a shit show - get rid of palettes, beef up rendering a lot
* draw_sprite takes a pointer, should be a const ref
* Add appversion to project template (cf build_release.py)
* Windows resource files are a mess, I'm not even sure what I intend to do with them
* I mostly like the asset build process in bootstrap (it's a good start at least) but it's irritating to have to build when iterating
* Can I haz fullscreen?
* Win32 build feels nasty
* 32/64-bit OS detection is broke (WIN32 is defined in 64-bit builds)
* I would enjoy to have a file of cvars (which could be baked for release builds)
    * Opens an exciting door of a custom pre-processor
